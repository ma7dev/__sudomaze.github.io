-   problem: remembering cloze setup rather than what is being asked in the question, aka cheating
-   helpful tips
    -   keep the card simple, no a lot of text, just atomic idea
        -   this might not work for proofs as you will need to understand what is the proof actually stating rather than memorizing the text. Hence, try to include a short answer of the proof and supplement links for the actual proof
        -   for the proof, you can use cloze to know what is the next step of the proof (answer)
    -   card interval is too short, wait for longer time and it won't be easy
    -   card numbers is too small
-   cloze surrounding information
    -   ex:
        -   bad: Every \{\{c1::Tuesday}} the sky is blue but every {c1::Friday}} it is red.
        -   good: Every \{\{c1::Tuesday}} the sky is \{\{c1::blue}} but every \{\{c2::Friday}} it is \{\{c2:\:red}}.
    -   you won't memorize the surrounding information of the needed question
-   reformulate the problems
    -   before: \{\{c1::X}} is a symptom of disease Y
    -   after: Disease Y has \{\{c1::X}} as a symptom
