-   work in parallel by working on multiple projects at the same time
-   how? manage allocation of time needed to work on those projects/tasks
-   this will help your mind to successful accomplish multiple projects/tasks while being on track
-   [[Procrastination But Mitigated]] shows a method of managing those multiple projects
-   best approach might be to work allocate a solid unchanged timeframe for the most important thing, such as thesis work, and have multiple projects, such as homework, articles, etc. with different completion time and timeframe to be worked on in parallel.

-   I think the time when to work is important. Working early in the morning will result to a more clear mindset, hence, high quality work to be done
-   try to work on the most important things early on the morning for clearlity sake
