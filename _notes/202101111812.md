-   steps of Zettelkasten

    -   Literature Notes (write in your own words)
    -   Brief notes about the reference of the notes and some words about the total content
        -   what does this mean?
    -   Fleeting Notes
        -   My thoughts about the ideas presented
    -   Sorting the notes not-important and important notes -> the important notes are the permanent notes

-   example
    -   start a Literature note
        -   fill metadata
        -   copy and paste logics and write literature notes about them
            -   does this mean paraphrasing?
    -   include at the end a fleet note (what the idea is about)
    -   if important, create a permanent note of the fleet note
